title: a fool in doubt
---
<p>i have some ideas on life, many of which get challenged by family, friends, and stuff that happens all around me. am
  i right, or am i wrong? is there even a right and wrong?</p>

<p>the posts below are the way <strong>i</strong> thought and reasoned about stuff - on the days the post was written. i
  can't claim that these allowed me to live the best version of my life - and I make no claims whatsover that
  they can help you live better.</p>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    <small><i> - {{ post.date | date: "%b %d, %Y"}}</i></small>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

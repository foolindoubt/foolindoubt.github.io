<h1>deciding good vs bad</h1>


<p>one way to decide if a strategy or way to do some thing is good or bad, might be to imagine everyone in the world adopting the same strategy - and trying to decide for yourself if you'd want to live in a world like that.

<p>have you considered asking a friend / acquaintance for help with referrals for job interviews? would you want to live in a world where every interview was decided based on a referral?

<p>if you had a friend in an event management company, would you ask them for free/discounted tickets for concerts you like? would you want to live in a world where every ticket for an event was handed out to friends of people organising the event?

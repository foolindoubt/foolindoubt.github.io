title: good and bad

<p>we face choices all the time. in some of these choices, we might be trying to decide amongst what we consider to be
    <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> (or maybe right or wrong?) options. I've noticed there are a couple of principles I tend
    to fall back on when trying to make such decisions.
</p>

<hr style="width:30%">

<p><strong>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</strong></p>

<p>the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm">golden rule</a> -- this applies to choices of actions involving
    people. imagine yourself to be on the receiving end
    of the decision - would you be happy with the choice that was made?
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>imagine you've been dealt unfairly by a corporation. you have the choice of giving the customer service rep
            and
            earful, or figuring out a resolution.</p>

        <p><i>if you were the service rep, what would you have wished happen in this case?</i></p>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr style="width:30%">

<p><strong>what if every person in the world were doing the same thing as i?</strong></p>

<p>
    i think this principle helps me avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
        the commons</a>.
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>have you considered asking a friend / acquaintance for help with referrals for job interviews? </p>
        <p><i>would you want to live in a world where every interview was decided based on a referral?</i></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if you had a friend in an event management company, would you ask them for free/discounted tickets for
            concerts you like?</p>
        <p><i>would you want to live in a world where every ticket for an event was handed out to friends of people
                organising the event?</i></p>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr style="width:30%">

<p>both the above this are easier said than done, of course. it is very hard to control my emotions in the moment - and
    I typically need a few seconds, minutes or even days to arrive at what I already realise is the right choice.
</p>

<p>sometimes, i don't arrive at the choice at all.</p>

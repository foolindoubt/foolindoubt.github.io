<p>we make choices all the time. some of these choices might be amongst what we consider to be <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>
(or maybe right or wrong?) options. I've noticed there are a couple of principles I tend to fall back on when trying
to choose the <i>right</i> option. I choice I wouldn't regret. </p>

<hr style="width:30%">

<p><strong>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</strong></p>

<p>the golden rule -- this applies to choices of actions involving
    people. imagine yourself to be on the receiving end
    of the decision - would you be happy with the choice that was made?
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>imagine you've been dealt unfairly by a corporation. you have the choice of giving the customer service rep
            and
            earful, or figuring out a resolution.</p>

        <p><i>if you were the service rep, what would you have wished happen in this case?</i></p>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr style="width:30%">

<p><strong>what if every person in the world were doing the same thing as i?</strong></p>

<p>
    i think this principle helps me avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
        the commons</a>.
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>have you considered asking a friend / acquaintance for help with referrals for job interviews? </p>
        <p><i>would you want to live in a world where every interview was decided based on a referral?</i></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if you had a friend in an event management company, would you ask them for free/discounted tickets for
            concerts you like?</p>
        <p><i>would you want to live in a world where every ticket for an event was handed out to friends of people
                organising the event?</i></p>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr style="width:30%">

<p><strong>what would my role model do?</strong></p>

<p>I know people at work who are excellent at getting things done, friends who are great at socialising and
    making people comfortable, and relatives who make me feel at home every time I talk to or visit them. thinking of
    them in uncertain situations works like a cheatsheet for me - sometimes it is so obvious how this person I know
    would have acted when faced with a similar situation.</p>

<p>i realise that the people i think of are only human, and not perfect. also, not every person is perfect or every
    situation. however, they do help me improve upon the person I am, today.</p>

<hr style="width:30%">

<p>following the principles above is easier said than done, of course. i find it very hard to control my emotions in the
moment - and I typically need a few seconds, minutes or even days to commit to what I know to be the right choice.
</p>

<p>sometimes, i fail to commit to the right choice altogether.</p>

title: expensive things
---

<p>instinctively, i've shrugged off expensive items as extravagant -- something i'd never get for myself. i've had a
    lower middle class upbringing -- no refrigerator growing up, and a color tv only in high school. i was amused when i
    became aware of 10x, 100x, 100x more expensive brands/versions of items i owned, but i always dismissed them as
    "rich people" things.

<p>i now realise that some, if not many, of the expensive items are expensive for a reason. it is important i
    understand why items are expensive, and if the reason is relevant to me. that doesn't have to mean that the
    expensive item is right for me - but it does mean that i'm not immediately dismissive of expensive items.</p>

<p>i saw this <a href="https://www.citizenwatch-global.com/one/">watch</a> in a store. it is orders of
    magnitude more expensive than any watch i've ever owned. however, it was also unlike any other watch i (or most
    people i know) have owned. why was it more expensive? it was slim, and i'd never have to worry about charging it.
    these reasons appeal to me - and i see myself getting one someday.</p>

<p>or, how about <a href="https://www.davidoscarson.com/writing.htm">these pens</a>? i really, really like some of them.
    what makes these expensive, if i understand correctly, is that these are hand-made, and only a few exist for any
    given design. these are truly scarce items, and therefore expensive. i long for these pens -- but i can't imagine
    paying the price.</p>

<p>a friend told me about <a href="https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/commercial/cmc850.html">this induction
        cooker</a>. again, orders of magnitude more than what i'd ever have imagined paying for a portable stovetop. but
    it can hold its temperature, really, really well.

    is this important to me? no. but i know it exists, and i appreciate its features and its price.</p>

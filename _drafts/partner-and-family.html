title: partner and family
---
<p>you've decided to spend the rest of your life with someone. you, or your partner, or the both of you also have
    families that you're bringing along into the relationship.</p>

<p>everyone's relationship with their family is unique. some people are close to their families, others only to a few
    selected folks, and some are not close at all. i reckon the relationship you have with your family is not exactly
    the same as the one your partner has with their family.</p>

<p>a couple of things will now happen -- both for your and your partner's perspective
<ul>
    <li>expection: their relationship to your family should somewhat approximate your own
    </li>
    <li>behavior: your relationship to your partners family will approximate your own</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>since we know that everyone's relationship with their family is unique -- the expectation and behavior are unlikely
    to match, and are a potential source of conflict.</p>

<p>who is responsible for the relations between your partner and <b>your</b> family? oh of course, perhaps both of you
    are. but ... who is accountable?

<p>i think it is you. it is difficult for your partner to know the right thing to think, say, or do with/about your
    family because they're new to the family. you (hopefully) already know how they think - and can help navigate both
    your family and the partner closer to each other.

<p>you should let your partner know what is expected of them. if they are uncomfortable with those expectations - own
    the discomfort as well. empathise, and see if their discomfort makes sense. if it even remotely does - present the
    feelings to your family as something both you and your partner share. don't throw your partner under the bus.

<p>you set the example for how your partner should be treated, to your family. your family will pick up on your behavior
    - and that might be better than explicitly asking them to do certain things. your partner likes being thanked? make
    sure to thank them yourself when your family is around. do they like playing with kids? try to have some play time
    with kids in your (extended) family.

<h1>your family and your partner</h1>

<p>who is responsible for the relations between your partner and <b>your</b> family? oh of course, perhaps both of you are. but ... who is accountable?

<p>i think it is you. it is difficult for your partner to know the right thing to think, say, or do with/about your family because they're new to the family. you (hopefully) already know how they think - and can help navigate both your family and the partner closer to each other.

<p>you should let your partner know what is expected of them. if they are uncomfortable with those expectations - own the discomfort as well. empathise, and see if their discomfort makes sense. if it even remotely does - present the feelings to your family as something both you and your partner share. don't throw your partner under the bus.

<p>you set the example for how your partner should be treated, to your family. your family will pick up on your behavior - and that might be better than explicitly asking them to do certain things. your partner likes being thanked? make sure to thank them yourself when your family is around. do they like playing with kids? try to have some play time with kids in your (extended) family.
